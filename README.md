# setup

Install dependecies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Generate the types:
```
python ./generate.py
```

Copy the `specification.py` file to your project.

Requires py3.8 and up.

NOTE: Do not import types that begin with `__`. These types are internal types and are not meant to be used.
